	<p class="origin-par">Astronomers officially recognize 88 constellations covering the entire sky in the northern and southern hemispheres. Currently, 14 men and women, 9 birds, two insects, 19 land animals, 10 water creatures, two centaurs, one head of hair, a serpent, a dragon, a flying horse, a river and 29 inanimate objects are represented in the night sky (the total comes to more than 88 because some constellations include more than one creature.) It is important to realize that the great majority of star patterns bear little, if any, resemblance to the figures they are supposed to represent and whose name they bear. The ancient constellation-makers probably meant for them to be symbolic, not literal, representations of their favorite animals or fabled heroes, a kind of celestial "Hall of Fame."

	<p class="second-par">Our modern constellation system comes to us from the ancient Greeks. The oldest description of the constellations as we know them comes from a poem, called Phaenomena, written about 270 B.C. by the Greek poet Aratus. However, it is clear from the poem that the constellations mentioned originated long before Aratus' time. No one is sure exactly where, when, or by whom they were invented. And yet a little detective work reveals a plausible origin.
