			<h2>Ursa Minor</h2>
			<p>The constellation Ursa Minor contains the group of stars commonly called the Little Dipper. The handle of the Dipper is the Little Bear’s tail and the Dipper’s cup is the Bear’s flank. The Little Dipper is not a constellation itself, but an asterism, which is a distinctive group of stars.
			</p>

			<p class="minorpar">The most famous star in Ursa Minor is Polaris, the North Star. This is the star that is nearest to the North Celestial Pole. If you stood at the north pole, Polaris would be almost directly overhead. If you can spot Polaris in the sky, you can always tell which way is north. In addition, the angle of Polaris above the horizon tells you your latitude on the Earth. Because of this, Polaris was the most important star for navigating at sea.
